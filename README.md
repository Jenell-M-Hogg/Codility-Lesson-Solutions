# Codility-Lesson-Solutions
Some tests I completed on Codility.com

Codility is an organization dedicated to testing the ability of coders. Here are some lessons I completed, in a variety of languages

See https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/ to see what I'm talking about!

Each file includes the question that was asked, the run-time and memory specifications for each algorithm, and the score I was 
graded for my solution.
